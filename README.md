# libsift [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/b3h47pte/libsift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/b3h47pte/libsift)

This repository provides an open-source implementation of the popular SIFT algorithm in various programming languages. An effort has been made to minimize the number of external dependencies used. See the appropriate sub-folder for instructions on usage. Currently this project is geared more towards being a functional and referenceable implementation than being a fast and optimized one.
